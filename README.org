This project provides useful VHDL support for Emacs in terms of navigation.

* About

[[https://csantosb.github.io/blog/2015/12/23/vhdl-tools/][Vhdl-tools]] provides a minor mode intended to be used under [[https://guest.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~zimmi/emacs/vhdl-mode.html][vhdl-mode]].
It adds specific functionality on top of [[https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags][ggtags]], [[http://batsov.com/projectile/][projectile]], =imenu= and
[[https://github.com/tj64/outshine][outshine]] to ease navigating vhdl sources. It expects a working setup of
=ggtags=, completing it with

  - Jumping into instances
  - Jump to upper level
  - Searching for references
  - Link and headings management
  - Custom use of =imenu=

* Install

Manual installation: as usual, download it, add to path and require after
loading =vhdl-mode=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'vhdl-mode
    (add-to-list 'load-path "...")
    (require 'vhdl-tools))
#+end_src

This package is available fom [[http://stable.melpa.org/#/vhdl-tools][Melpa]] too, you may install it by calling

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x package-install RET vhdl-tools
#+end_src

Then, activate the minor mode by completing the =vhdl-mode= hook.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'vhdl-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (vhdl-tools-mode 1)))
#+end_src

* Setup

=VHDL-tools= expects a correct setup of the packages it relies on

- configure [[https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags][ggtags]]
- setup [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] by putting it under version control with [[https://git-scm.com/][git]]

Finally, if you plan to use [[https://github.com/tj64/outshine][outshine]] by setting =vhdl-tools-use-outshine= to
true, just don’t [[https://github.com/tj64/outshine#installation][forget]] to

#+begin_src example
  (require 'outshine)
  (add-hook 'outline-minor-mode-hook 'outshine-hook-function)
#+end_src

before activating =vhdl-tools=. Remember to

#+begin_src example
  (add-to-list 'company-begin-commands 'outshine-self-insert-command)
#+end_src

otherwise =company= idle completion using the =capf= backed won’t [[https://github.com/tj64/outshine/issues/38][work]] (see
[[#related-utilities][Related utilities]] section below).

* Use

** Headings

Following the status of the =vhdl-tools-use-outshine= flag (off by default),
when the mode is enabled, =vhdl-tools= will activate =outline-minor-mode=
locally and =outshine= globally, setting =vhdl-tools-outline-regexp= as the
regexp used to locate headings.

This enables using this kind of headings

#+begin_src example
  -- * Header Level 1

  -- ** Header Level 2
  MyInstance : MyComponent
      port map ( ...
#+end_src

to delimit code blocks.

Then, call =outshine-speed-command-help= to get an overview over the available
functionality and the keybindings. Additionally, the following keybinds are
provided to navigate headings

  + =C-c C-n=, get to next header
  + =C-c C-h=, get to previous header

** Custom Imenu

The following keybinds are made available to browse current buffer contents

  + =C-x c i m=    standard imenu
  + =C-x c i i=    instances
  + =C-x c i c=    components
  + =C-x c i p=    processes
  + =C-x c i SPC=  headers (with a prefix argument use ido instead)
  + =C-x c i a=    all items

** Custom SmartScan

Following the status of the =vhdl-tools-remap-smartscan= and
=vhdl-tools-use-outshine= flags (off by default), when the mode is enabled,
=vhdl-tools= will customize the behaviour of =smartscan-symbol-go-forward= and
=smartscan-symbol-go-backward=, so that they manage folding/unfolding of section
headings. This way, upon jumping, only the relevant section is shown.

** Org vhdl

Following the literate programming paradigm, it is possible to tangle an
org-mode file containing source code blocks to a source code file. This helps
documenting code, for example. Assuming its names are identical, and only its
extension changes, it is possible to jump from the source to the org file with

  + =C-C M-^=      jump from vhdl to org

Up to the user to define a key to jump from org to vhdl source code, as for
example

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c M-,") #'vhdl-tools-jump-from-org)
#+end_src

When tangling the org file, this code helps to set proper indentation,
whitespace fixup, alignment, and case fixing to entire buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-babel-post-tangle-hook
            (lambda ()
              (when (string= major-mode "vhdl-mode")
                (vhdl-beautify-buffer)
                (save-buffer))))
#+end_src

** Jumping around

The following keybinds are available

  + =C-c M-D=, jumps to the definition of symbol at point

    [[file:JumpDef.gif][JumpDef.gif]]

  + =C-c M-w=, stores a link
  + =C-c M-y=, pastes a link
  + =C-c M-j=, follows the link at point

    [[file:Links.gif][Links.gif]]

  + =C-c M-.=, jumps into the instance at point

    [[file:JumpIntoInstance.gif][JumpIntoInstance.gif]]

  + =C-c M-a=, moves point to first appearance of symbol at point

    [[file:JumpFirst.gif][JumpFirst.gif]]

  + =C-c M-u=, jumps to upper hierarchy level

    [[file:JumpUpper.gif][JumpUpper.gif]]

Cursor will jump to the target if there is one, searching packages too. The ring
mark is push after jumping, so to get back, press =C-c C-p= or M-, (default
binds under =ggtags=) if corresponding definition has been found. Works better
for files with correct syntax: think =vhdl-beautify-buffer= before using
=vhdl-tools=.

Also have a look at customization possibilities with =M-x customize-group vhdl-tools=.

** Misc

+ =C-c M-b=, beautify current block (module, etc.)

Some additional emacs packages useful in this context

- [[https://github.com/mickeynp/smart-scan][smart scan]] :: Jumps between other symbols found at point in Emacs
- [[https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon][beacon]] :: A light that follows your cursor around so you don't lose it!
- [[https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode][aggressive-indent-mode]] :: Emacs minor mode that keeps your code always
     indented. More reliable than electric-indent-mode
